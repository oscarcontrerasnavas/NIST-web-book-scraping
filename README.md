# Scraping the NIST Webbook with Python to extract Antoine Equation Parameters

As Chemical Engineers can know, performing chemical processes often needs them to use tabulated data on websites coded before API's time so there is no other way to get the information that manually copy and paste it into their owns (probably MS Excel) Databases and then import it into workflow for such calculating purposes.

With this idea on mind it was built a small script for extracting the *Antoine Equation Parameters* from the **National Institute of Standards and Technology** of  the U.S. Department of Commerce [Online Chemistry Webbook](https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/). However, if any of the readers want to get another data from the same or different source, I hope the explanation showed [here](https://oscarcontrerasnavas.github.io/python/nist-web-book-scraping.html) will be good enough for them to achieve it.
